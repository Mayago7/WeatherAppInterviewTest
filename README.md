# WeatherAppInterviewTest
Coding test for interview

- As indicated on the instructions here's the app for the interview, sadly I didn't have much time to work on it the way I wanted to because I'm currently closing my current project and things are a little hectic but I was able to complete the functionality and some Bonus features from the PDF file, sadly I really didn't have any time to work on the animations, slide gesture to update, XcTests and refactoring the code for a better presentation.

- This app consists of 2 main screens in it's User Experience, I decided to make it a simple as possible so it has a "Welcome" screen that it purpose is to get User permission and Obtain Device location for initially feeding the Main screen, after this process is complete the user can see a top section that consists on 1 button to refresh the data with the user location and a search bar to look for any city provided by Open Weather API, then we a have the middle section where the current weather data is displayed to the user showing City name, current date, weather condition, weather description, temperature in F and a dynamic icon depending if temperatre is cold-hot or in the middle, the bottom section with consists on the forecast for the next 5 days as smaller rows containing date, weather condition, weather description, max temperature, min temperature and the same dynamic icon as visual representation.

- As you will notice by looking at the code I implemented the error handlers as requested but didn't have enough time to work on a UI representation to interact with the user so it has only print statements, I wanted to improve the design and user interaction experience but this is what I was able to complete in the time frame, I also was planning in implementing dynamic backgrounds depending on the weather conditions and a better representations of the loading screens since the networking is so fast they look almost non existent, my plan was also implement MVVM but sadly I ended up just using Location and Network managers, I prioritize to complete functionalty as much as possible.

- As the same time frame situation previusly discussed I ended up completing the project before even creating the repo here on GitHub, that's why you won't see any commits or different branches from main, I hope this doesn't affect too much on a negative way.

- The challenges I encountered while developing this app were technicalities, mostly was the Weather API KEY which took almost 45 minutes to activate after creation on the portal and also my personal mac wasn't able to connect to my iPhone for testing, this is a trivial updates-permissions-code signing situation but also took some time to fix, I didn't have noticable issues during development aside from that.
